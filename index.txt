Hi. My name is Alexander Jung and im an Assistant Professor for Machine Learning. A recent focus of my research is on federated multi-task learning in massive collections of networked datasets ("big data over networks"). I am also passionate about teaching the basic principles of machine learning. I currently enjoy working on the textbook "Machine Learning. The Basics". This textbook is targeted towards undergraduate students of engineering or science programs.
