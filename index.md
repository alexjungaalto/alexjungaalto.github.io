Hi. My name is Alexander Jung and im an Assistant Professor for Machine Learning. A recent focus of my research is on federated multi-task learning in massive collections of networked datasets ("big data over networks"). I am also passionate about teaching the basic principles of machine learning. 

I currently enjoy working on the textbook "Machine Learning. The Basics". This textbook is targeted towards undergraduate students of engineering and science programs. You can find a current working draft of the book [here](https://github.com/alexjungaalto/alexjungaalto.github.io/blob/master/MLBasicsBook.pdf)

If you find this book useful for your blog post, research article or product, I would be grateful if you would cite this book as follows: 

Jung, Alexander. "Machine Learning. The Basics.", 2021. https://github.com/alexjungaalto/alexjungaalto.github.io/blob/master/MLBasicsBook.pdf.
