## Welcome to the GitHub page of Alex Jung. 

I am an Assistant Professor for Machine Learning. The current focus of my research is on **federated multi-task learning in massive collections of networked datasets ("big data over networks")**. I am also passionate about teaching the basic principles of machine learning. I currently enjoy working on the textbook "Machine Learning. The Basics". This textbook is targeted towards undergraduate students of engineering or science programs. 

You can find a current working draft of the book [here](https://alexjungaalto.github.io/MLBasicsBook.pdf). If you find this book useful for your blog post, research article or product, I would be grateful if you would cite this book as follows:
